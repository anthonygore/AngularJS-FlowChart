This is the same as https://github.com/codecapers/AngularJS-FlowChart, the only difference is that the connectors
are on the tops and bottoms of the nodes rather than the sides. This makes it a little more practical for fitting
in a browser window, the downside is that the connector names should really only be 1 character.
